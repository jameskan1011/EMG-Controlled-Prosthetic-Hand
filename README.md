# EMG-Controlled-Prosthetic-Hand

This project features a wireless prosthetic hand system powered by EMG signal control. A wearable glove captures muscle activity and translates it into movement commands for a robotic hand. At the same time, force sensors on the robotic fingers detect contact pressure and send feedback signals wirelessly, activating a vibration motor on the glove. The entire bidirectional communication is handled efficiently using the ESP-NOW protocol.
