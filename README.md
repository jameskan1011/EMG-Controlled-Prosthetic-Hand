# EMG-Controlled Prosthetic Hand

This project features a **wireless prosthetic hand system** powered by EMG signal control.  
A wearable EMG device captures muscle activity and translates it into movement commands for a robotic hand.  
Force sensors on the robotic fingers detect contact pressure and send feedback wirelessly to activate a **vibration motor** on the glove.  
All communication is handled efficiently via the **ESP-NOW protocol** for real-time response.

- **Pinch and Power Grip Control:** Specific EMG signals trigger predefined hand movements ‚Äî either pinch or power grip ‚Äî based on which sensor is activated.
- **Wireless Haptic Feedback:** FSR sensors on the prosthetic fingers detect contact force and activate a vibration motor on the wearable in real-time.
- **Low-Latency Communication:** ESP-NOW enables fast, two-way communication between the wearable and robotic hand without needing a Wi-Fi network.
- **Compact and Lightweight:** Designed for wearable use, the system minimizes bulk and weight for user comfort and mobility.
